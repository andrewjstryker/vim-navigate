*Navigate* *navigate* *navigate.vim*

Most Vim users control the cursor with the h, j, k, and l keys in normal mode.
The Navigate plugin makes use of those unused cursor movement keys by defining
four navigation "states".

CONTENTS						*navigate-contents*

1. Overview of defined mappings  |navigate-states|
2. Configuration  |navigate-configuration|

The functionality mentioned here is a plugin, see |add-plugin|.  You can avoid
loading this plugin by setting a "navigate_loaded" variable in your |vimrc|
file: >

	let g:navigate_loaded = 1

NOTE:  This plugin changes the function of commonly used keys, such as the
cursor keys.  Further, it will conflict with plugins that make use of it.

{Vi does not have any of this}

                                                        *navigate-buffer*

1. Navigate states                                      *navigate-states*

The following table shows the mappings in effect for each of the navigate
states.  The column labeled "Normal" shows the default bindings.  These
mappings are only in effect while in normal mode.

Normal		Buffer		Window		Quick Fix ~
<Del>		:bdelete<CR>	<C-W>q		<Del>
<Home>		:bfirst<CR>	<C-W>t		:cfirst<CR>
<End>		:blast<CR>	<C-W>b		:clast<CR>
<PageUp>	<PageUp>	<C-W>W		<PageUp>
<PageDown>	<PageDown>	<C-W>w		<PageDown>
<Up>		:buffer #<CR>	<C-W><Up>	:clist<CR>
<Left>		:bprevious<CR>	<C-W><Left>	:cprevious<CR>
<Right>		:bnext<CR>	<C-W><Right>	:cnext<CR>
<Down>		:buffer 	<C-W><Down>	<Down>

There are two ways to select the navigation state.  Within gVim, there are
menu option under Plugin -> Navigate to select navigate states.  The navigate
plugin also defines two functions to cycle through navigate states.  The
functions are automatically mapped to <Leader>n and <Leader>N, though this can
be changed.  <Leader>n cycles Normal -> Buffer -> Window -> Quick Fix.
<Leader>N cycles in the reverse direction.  Typically, <Leader> is the "\"
character.  See |<Leader>| for details.

2. Configuration                                      *navigate-configuration*

The Navigate plugin defines two configurable mappings and four configurable
variables.

Mapping to the NavigateCycle and ReverseNavigateCycle functions overrides the
mapping to <Leader>n and <Leader>N, respectively.  For example, inserting >

	nmap <Tab> <Plug>NavigateCycle

into a |vimrc| file, will map the Navigate function to the <Tab> key when in
normal mode (see |nmap|).  Pressing the <Tab> key will then cycle through the
navigate states.

The are three variables that can be used to control the Navigate plugin are:

Variable			Purpose ~
navigate_loaded			surpresses the plugin
navigate_state			sets the start-up navigate state
navigate_no_announce		surpress the "X navigate" message when
				changing navigate states (0 - do not surpress,
				otherwise surpress)
navigate_top_menu		set the root of the menu structure

Each of these variables can be set in a |vimrc| file.  For example, >

	:let navigate_no_announce = 0

will surpress the announcements when changing navigate states.

The navigate_state variable can take the following settings:

Setting		Meaning ~
0		enter the |navigate-normal| state next (default)
1		enter the |navigate-buffer| state next
2		enter the |navigate-window| state next
3		enter the |navigate-quickfix| state next
other		enter the |navigate-normal| state next

As an example, setting navigate_state to 1 in the |vimrc| file will cause
Vim to start in the |navigate-buffer| state.

The navigate_top_menu needs to be a string that ends with a period, such as >

	let g:navigate_top_menu = "Plugin."

See |:menu| for details about the defining the menu structure.
